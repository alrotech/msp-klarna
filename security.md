# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) and follow [SemVer](https://semver.org) during the working process, which means that the most secure version is the latest version of the code.

We do not support previous versions, and we do not provide any LTS releases. We strongly recommend every time to update to the latest one. 

We try to keep backward compatibility. If it is impossible, we provide explicit instructions for upgrading. We try to automate it with migration scripts as well.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

All requests about issues we receive via [the support portal](https://modstore.pro/office/support) on the marketplace website.

Alternatively, you can send an email with found security issue to the email - support@mspay.by.
